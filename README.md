## How we got here
Welcome to my repository focused on networking and cloud infrastructure, with some other stuff that I wanted to keep. After migrating from an old Wordpress blog platform to S3, I've preserved some of my most useful technical articles [elsewhere](https://www.simonpainter.com) while continuing to share new insights about networking, cloud architecture, and infrastructure automation.
