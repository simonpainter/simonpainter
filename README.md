# Somewhere to keep things

## How we got here
Welcome to my repository focused on networking and cloud infrastructure, with some other stuff that I wanted to keep. After migrating from an old Wordpress blog platform to GitHub, I've preserved some of my most useful technical articles while continuing to share new insights about networking, cloud architecture, and infrastructure automation.
