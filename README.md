# Simon Painter

## How we got here
Welcome to my repository focused on networking and cloud infrastructure, with some other stuff that I wanted to keep. After migrating from an old Wordpress blog platform to S3, I've preserved some of my most useful technical articles [elsewhere](https://www.simonpainter.com) while continuing to share new insights about networking, cloud architecture, and infrastructure automation.

## Repositories
* [Using pcaps to measure ttfb](https://github.com/simonpainter/capture_latency)
> I wanted to test the latency impact of several different FQDN filter methods so I came up with this to measure time to first usable byte (ttfb) which measures the TCP and SSL handshake times through L7 firewalls.
* [MoodBadger](https://github.com/simonpainter/MoodBadger)
> I saw the Badger2040 e-paper board and created this for my son to help him communciate his feelings as he's about as good at that as I am. 
* [Chatbot](https://github.com/simonpainter/chatbot)
> This emerged out of a friendly bit of banter with my neighbour via LinkedIn. 
* [Enforza Proof of Concept](https://github.com/Refried-Bean/enforza_poc)
> This is a terraform plan for a small proof of concept that is great for testing [enforza](https://www.enforza.io) firewall.
